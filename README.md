# Gtd_Automations
Scripts developed a few years ago while I was working at Gtd, automating tasks related to Gmail, Excel, Netcracker or Cisco devices; heavily redacted recently so no sensitive data is revealed.

This code repository is mostly for show as an extension of my resume, since I removed huge chunks of code that is required to make it work (like device and network access, obviously).

//Still cleaning code to upload.
