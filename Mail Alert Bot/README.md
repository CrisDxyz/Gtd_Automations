# Alert Email Script

This is a real internal alert script I wrote for production use at a large company.  
It includes some internal humor (in Spanish) because that’s how I kept things human — even in automation context.

I intentionally left the script in its imperfect form, with jokes, Spanish comments, and bits of real structure, to show how these tools actually looked in use. It’s heavily redacted, so it won’t run as-is — but that’s the point. This is a **"look over my shoulder"** kind of example.

## What it does (in concept)

- Sends alert emails using HTML + plain-text.
- Dynamically fills in info about a branch or system ("sucursal").
- Uses SMTP (e.g., Gmail or Outlook) for sending.
- Was used to notify teams when internal checks detected a problem.
- Was mixed with other scripts to interact with stuff like Excel, Netcracker and Network Devices.

## What to expect

- Broken or incomplete variables.
- Base64-encoded placeholder images.
- Jokes.
- Comments in Spanglish.
- **Real structure, real code, real intent — just redacted.**

## Want to use this?

If you want a clean version you can build from, check out generic_main.py.
It’s a functional, neutral, boilerplate version of this same logic.
